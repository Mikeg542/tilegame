TODO List:

Tiles
- Figure out how to apply tileset with larger entites (have multiple ids be different parts? have 1 id and a size?)
- how to link maps (map of maps? specific ids that are portals to a map #?)
- layered tiles (tree on grass vs tree on plains. entites vs tile, or unique tiles in spritesheet)

- Should ids be descriptive or easier to work with? (should a creature have a type of "fire" or a type of 1)

- data format for saving
